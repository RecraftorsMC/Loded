# Loded

Ever got annoyed at the fact that you needed to go all the way back
to a lodestone in order to make a copy of a lodestone compass?

Then wave your worries goodbye, for with this mod, you can now copy
any lodestone compass unto another one using an anvil. For the
sole cost of two levels, combine a lodestone compass and any other
compass to get back two copies of the first compass!

### Compatibility

This mod uses a custom item tag, `#loded:compasses`, which also
extends the `#c:compasses` item tag, in order to identify the
first compass. The second must be of the same item type as the
first one. This mod also uses the vanilla lodestone compass check
method. If those three criteria are validated, any modded compass
can also be copied using this mod.
